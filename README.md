*DISCLAMER: If download the project and use it to see the website, just want to let you know that is not finished*

First, want to give credit to Methsara & Eslem for the inspiration and starting a trend for us to follow for the Incomplete Project Internship 

Students & Professors navigating through the website to complete the INC Grade. 

To increase the understanding of Incomplete grade, I put social media links where users could interact with BMCC Social Media to know more about it. 

Ye & I created a login, password, profile upload picture. 

The student section:

Right side: Profile picture, major, AI Planner, what course they have INC grade in

Left side: HW Assignments, Mid-terms Finals, Upload Files 

Top Section: Even though it does look like a loading screen, it suppose to go up anytime a student completes a assignment 

They will be a hover bottom on where it shows a list of the assignments completed - Credit: Incomplete Faculty Jackie 

Professor Section:  

Will see a class structure, which will show a button that will full students and INC Grade students. 

Each will have a specific color, which is "Green" is Full Students that have passed the course and "Yellow" are the ones that are in INC status.

The Professor will have to click on the hover box and will be a option where a upload file option to assign the students and will check the status of the students as well. 

Thus, that is the problem. 

In the future, Generative AI will be accepted and people will use it to create anything, and depending on the individual they will know their stuff.
